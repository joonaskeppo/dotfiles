Minimal dotfiles for my macOS setup (formerly both Mac and Debian).

## Installation

- Ranger + Neovim integration via pip, not brew: `pip3 install ranger-fm pynvim` due to [some issues](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/rnvimr)
- Currently trying out the [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) version of Fira Code; may change later
